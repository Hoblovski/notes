# Labeled von Neumann Architecture for Software-Defined Cloud
> Journal of Computer Science and Technology

## Cloud computing
* Virtualized cloud: interference
* Partitioned cloud: low utilization
* Shared cloud: recently. Co-locates different workloads onto the same hw.
  - Long tail latency
  - Low utilization
  - High interference
  - Software defined cloud: Coordination among app, OS, virtualization and hw.
    `->` SDN: propagate upper application QoS down to hw.

## LvNA
In traditional vNA, shared memory hierarchies suffer from unmanaged sharing
problem e.g. LLC, leading to the noisy neighbor problem.
