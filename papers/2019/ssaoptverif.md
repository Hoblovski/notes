# Formal Verification of SSA-Based Optimizations for LLVM

# Problem
## Research Question
形式化验证 SSA 优化正确性.

## Existing Solutions, Their Troubles, c.f. Proposed Solution

## My Proposed Answer



# Proposed Solution
## Background

## General Idea

> However, formally verifying the correctness of SSA-based optimizations is

??? what properties, why entire CFG, why a challenge

what's the correctness condition

what's the connection with vellum


key idea: generalize SSA scoping to include safety predicates

## Main Obstacles and Resolution



# Evaluation
## Metric

## c.f. Existing solutions



# Retrospect
## Remaining confusions

## Future Work and Weakness of Proposed Solution
e.g. Performance? Labor? Economicalness? Elegance? Compatibility? Usefulness?

## My main take-away
